## Finding a visual language

By the start of 2023, Gryt existed as a proof of concept with authentication, a friends list, and a lot of ambition. What it didn't have was an identity. The UI was functional but generic — dark backgrounds, purple accents, and layouts that could've belonged to any app.

That changed in 2023. Over the course of a few months, I went through a series of design iterations that gradually turned Gryt from "a thing I'm building" into something with its own personality, its own design language, and eventually its own mascot.

## The first login revamp — January 2023

The first redesign of the login page arrived in **January 2023**. Gone was the glowing purple orb; in its place, a cleaner layout with a bold blue wavy background:

![First revamp of the login screen — dark form card against flowing blue waves, January 2023](/first_revamped_login_screen.png)

The form itself was more refined — proper field labels, a "Forgot your password?" link, and a cleaner visual hierarchy. It still felt like a prototype, but a more intentional one. The blue was calmer than the previous purple-pink gradient, and the organic wave shapes hinted at the direction I wanted to go: something that felt fluid and alive rather than rigid and corporate.

## The first sketches — early 2023

This was the turning point. In **early 2023**, I started sketching what Gryt would actually look like as a full communication platform — not just a login screen and a friends list, but a server experience with channels, members, profiles, and voice.

The first server layout sketch showed the "Gryta Krutt" server — named after the friend group that inspired everything:

![First sketch of the full server layout — "Gryta krutt" server with text channels, voice channels, and category sections, early 2023](/first_ever_sketch.png)

The structure was heavily influenced by what we knew from Discord — categories with text and voice channels, a sidebar for navigation — but it was unmistakably Gryt. The dark palette, the channel icons distinguishing text (#) from voice (microphone), and the notification badges were all designed from scratch.

Alongside the server layout, I designed the members list panel:

![First sketch of the members list — role-based sections with avatar icons for Owners, Moderators, and Members, early 2023](/first_ever_sketch_members_list.png)

Owners at the top with golden crowns, moderators with shield icons, and regular members below. Each with custom avatars. This wasn't just about laying out a list — it was about establishing a role system and visual hierarchy that would carry through to the final product.

I also started sketching user interaction patterns. The user card popup was one of the first:

![First sketch of the user card — profile banner, avatar, role badges, status, and action buttons, early 2023](/first_ever_sketch_user_card.png)

A profile banner at the top, an avatar overlapping it, role badges ("Owners", "Gryt developer"), a custom status with an emoji, and quick-action buttons for messaging and adding as a friend. The user card needed to surface just enough information to be useful without requiring you to open a full profile.

And then the detailed profile view:

![First sketch of the expanded profile — cover image, avatar, badges, about me section, and linked social accounts, early 2023](/first_ever_sketch_of_detailed_profile.png)

This was the full profile experience: a cover image, a large avatar, an "About me" section, badges earned within the platform (Alpha Tester, Beta Tester, Badge Hunter), and linked social accounts. It was ambitious — maybe too ambitious for where the codebase was at the time — but it set the design direction.

This was the moment Gryt stopped being a generic dark-mode app and started becoming something with its own identity.

## The owl arrives — March 2023

**March 2023** was when two significant things happened: the login page got its second revamp, and the Gryt owl mascot made its first appearance.

![Second revamp of the login — the owl mascot peeks in from the corner, a pink login button adds playfulness, March 2023](/second_revamp_of_login.png)

Look at the top right corner — there's the owl, peeking in. "Welcome to Gryt" with a happy emoji. The pink login button was a departure from the blue-and-purple palette, adding a playful pop of color. The owl wasn't just decoration; it signaled that Gryt had a personality.

Around the same time, I got the web login running alongside the first version of the Electron desktop client:

![The web login page alongside the first Gryt desktop client — scattered icons on the background, the owl front and center with an "Authenticate" button, March 2023](/first_screenshot_of_new_login_with_first_client.png)

The browser shows the login form at `auth.gryt.chat`, with scattered icons (headphones, game controllers, chat bubbles, puzzle pieces) floating on the purple background. Next to it, the Gryt desktop client window — small, dark, with the owl as the centerpiece and a single "AUTHENTICATE" button. It was minimal, but it was *real*. Two apps talking to each other through the same authentication system.

With the owl established as the face of Gryt, I explored how it would work as a proper logo across different contexts — light mode, dark mode, and various background colors:

![Logo variations — the Gryt owl in light and dark variants across nine color combinations, including a beret edition and a rainbow background](/Logos.png)

The light owl for dark backgrounds, the dark owl for light backgrounds, and a few playful twists — the beret on the pink background, the rainbow variant. Having both modes meant the logo could live anywhere without losing legibility, whether on a dark app sidebar or a bright marketing page.

## The second iteration — April 2023

With the foundation laid, **April 2023** brought a wave of refinements. The user card got a significant upgrade:

![Second iteration of the user card — pixel art banner, refined layout, members list visible alongside, April 2023](/second_ever_sketch_profile_card.png)

The teal gradient banner was replaced with a detailed pixel art landscape — a sunset over mountains, a small figure with a lantern, and a castle in the distance. It felt like every profile could tell a story through its banner. The card layout was tighter, the role badges more refined.

The expanded profile view evolved too:

![Second iteration of the expanded profile — painted sky banner, updated badge system with Supporter tier, April 2023](/second_sketch_of_expanded_profile.png)

A painted sky replaced the nature photography of the first version. The badge system expanded to include "Supporter" alongside Alpha Tester, Beta Tester, and Badge Hunter. The social links section was cleaned up, and the overall composition felt more balanced.

## The design system takes shape

Also in **April 2023**, I moved the design work into Figma and started building a proper design system:

![The Gryt Design System in Figma — component library, color tokens, typography, app screens, and avatar collections, April 2023](/figma_screenshot.png)

This screenshot shows the full scope of what I was working on: a component library on the left with Message components broken down into their atomic parts (icons, names, content, collections), a "Discover" page mockup showing different app states, color style tokens on the right (Secondary, Ternary, Primary Content, BG, Neutral, and more), and rows of avatar designs and user interface variations.

At the bottom, a "Things to consider" notes section. Having a design system meant I could iterate faster and maintain consistency as the app grew.

## Space owl goes to space

One of my favorite artifacts from this era is the first promotional image for Gryt:

![First promo art for Gryt — the owl mascot as a tiny astronaut floating in space, tethered to a small rocket, surrounded by stars and planets, April 2023](/first_promo_of_gryt.png)

The owl, reimagined as a little astronaut floating through space, tethered to a tiny rocket. Stars and planets scattered around. It captured the spirit of the project — small but adventurous, exploring uncharted territory, not quite sure where it's heading but enjoying the journey.

## Server discovery

Another major design piece from this period was the server discovery page — a way to browse and join public communities:

![The Discover page — a grid of community servers with banners, descriptions, and member counts, with hostname and search filters on the left, April 2023](/gryt-server-browser.png)

A "Discover" panel with a hostname field (defaulting to `https://gryt.chat`), a server name filter, and a toggle for private servers. The grid layout showed each community with a banner image, server icon, name, and short description. Clicking a server opened a detail panel:

![Server detail panel — the Gryt community server showing its description, language tags, member count, and a "Request to join" button, April 2023](/gryt-server-browser-inspect.png)

The detail panel displayed the server's full description ("Welcome to our community! We are excited to have you here as a member of our growing community of privacy-conscious individuals"), language tags, member count, and a "Request to join" button. The idea was that discovering new communities should feel like browsing a curated marketplace, not sifting through invite links.

## Dashboard concepts

The same month brought dashboard designs that pushed the concept further:

![Dashboard concept — "Good Evening, Sivert" with an unread messages widget, customizable card slots, and server navigation, April 2023](/first_sketch_of_dashboard.png)

"Good Evening, Sivert" with a greeting that changed based on time of day. An unread messages widget pulling in messages from servers and DMs. A customizable card area where you could place whatever widgets mattered to you.

And the editing interface for customizing your dashboard:

![Dashboard editing mode — "Add New Card" dialog with widget options like unread messages, favorite friends, message stats, and a live preview, April 2023](/first_sketch_of_dashboard_editing.png)

An "Add New Card" dialog listing available widgets — unread messages, favorite friends, list of friends, unread mentions, message stats, server channel mini chat — with a live preview on the right. The idea was that your home screen would be yours to customize, not a one-size-fits-all layout.

## What I learned from the design phase

This entire era — from January through April 2023 — was about trial and error. Every sketch taught me something. The login revamps taught me that personality matters more than polish. The profile designs taught me that showing the right information at the right time is harder than it looks. The Figma system taught me that consistency requires structure.

None of this code shipped in its original form. The sketches were aspirational, the mockups were conceptual, and the design system was a target to aim at rather than a spec to implement. But every one of these designs shaped what Gryt would eventually become.

Looking at the full design mockup that emerged from this phase, you can see how far the vision had come:

![The polished Gryt mockup — a full server view with channels, chat messages, image sharing, emoji reactions, a members list, and voice channels, 2023](/gryt-first-draft-preview.png)

A complete server experience: sidebar with channel categories (Pins, General Chats, Community), a rich chat feed with messages in multiple languages, embedded images, emoji reactions, link previews, a members list with role-based coloring, and voice channels showing connected users. It was the blueprint.

The design work of 2023 was foundational but the codebase still wasn't there. It took another year before I sat down to turn these designs into a working product. Read about that in [From Concept to Reality](/blog/from-concept-to-reality).
