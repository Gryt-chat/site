## The most-requested feature

Ever since Gryt became self-hostable, the number one question has been: _"Can I run this on my Windows PC?"_

The answer used to involve Docker Desktop, WSL configuration, network bridge quirks, and a lot of patience. For someone who just wants to host a voice server for their friend group, that's way too much friction.

Today, the answer is simple: **download a zip, edit one file, double-click `start.bat`.**

## SQLite made this possible

This wouldn't have happened without the [move from ScyllaDB to SQLite](/blog/from-scylladb-to-sqlite). Dropping the external database dependency was the single biggest blocker. With ScyllaDB, you needed a running database container — and ScyllaDB doesn't run on Windows natively. SQLite is just a file. No container, no service, no configuration.

With the database out of the way, the remaining pieces fell into place: the signaling server runs on Node.js (cross-platform), the SFU compiles to a standalone `.exe` (Go cross-compilation), and the image worker is another Node.js process. Everything the server needs fits in a single folder.

## What's in the bundle

The Windows self-hosted bundle is a single zip file containing:

- **Signaling server** — the main Gryt backend (Node.js). Handles authentication, channels, messages, file uploads, and WebSocket connections.
- **SFU** — the media server (`gryt_sfu.exe`). Handles all WebRTC voice and video traffic. Compiled from Go, runs as a standalone binary.
- **Image worker** — processes uploaded images (thumbnails, resizing). Runs as a separate Node.js process so a crash in image processing never takes down the main server.
- **`config.env`** — one file with every setting. Server name, ports, storage backend — all in one place.
- **`start.bat`** — launches everything with one double-click.

The only thing you need to install is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or later). That's the sole external dependency.

## How it works

When you run `start.bat` for the first time, it does a quick one-time setup: rebuilding native Node.js modules (`better-sqlite3`, `sharp`) for your specific Node.js version. This takes a few seconds and only happens once.

After that, it starts three processes:

1. The **image worker** connects to the SQLite database and starts polling for image processing jobs
2. The **SFU** starts listening for WebRTC connections on port 5005
3. The **signaling server** starts on port 5000, connects to the SFU, and opens the WebSocket for clients

All three services read their configuration from `config.env`. No environment variable gymnastics, no Docker networking, no separate `.env` files to manage.

Once you see the startup banner, you're live. Connect with the [Gryt desktop app](https://github.com/Gryt-chat/gryt/releases) or [app.gryt.chat](https://app.gryt.chat) at `localhost:5000`. The first user to join becomes the server owner.

## It took a few rounds

I'll be honest: getting this working smoothly took more iteration than I expected. Cross-compiling native Node.js modules for Windows from a Linux build machine turned out to be the hard part. `better-sqlite3` ships prebuilt binaries tied to specific Node.js versions, and `sharp` needs platform-specific binaries that won't load if they were fetched for the wrong OS.

The solution was pragmatic: the build bundles what it can, and `start.bat` rebuilds the rest on first launch using whatever Node.js version is actually installed on the target machine. It adds a few seconds to the first startup, but it means the bundle works regardless of whether you're running Node 20, 22, or 25.

There were other rough edges too — SFU port conflicts, environment variable loading differences between Linux and Windows batch scripts, WebSocket path routing that worked behind a reverse proxy but not when running bare. Each one got caught and fixed through real testing on an actual Windows machine.

## Who this is for

This is designed for **local and LAN use cases**:

- **LAN parties** — spin up a voice server in seconds, no internet required
- **Friend groups** — host a persistent server on a spare PC or your daily driver

For production deployments on a VPS or cloud server, [Docker Compose](/docs/deployment/docker-compose) is still the recommended path. It gives you automatic restarts, easier TLS setup, and a more standard ops workflow.

But if you just want voice chat for your friends and you have a Windows PC, this is all you need.

## Try it

1. Install [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the latest `gryt-server-windows-x64-v*.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Gryt-chat/server/releases)
3. Extract, edit `config.env`, double-click `start.bat`

Full setup instructions, firewall configuration, and troubleshooting are in the [Windows deployment guide](https://docs.gryt.chat/docs/deployment/windows).
